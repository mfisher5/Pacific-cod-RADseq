# Prepping Migrate input files on Hyak

#### M. Fisher

## Description
Prepare Migrate input files using Stacks output. 

(1) Access the MERlab Hyak node, (2) download Stacks v1.44, and (3) re-run `populations` to produce a RAD loci FASTA file.

## 1: Access the MERlab Hyak Node

This is my first time entering Hyak, and I'm doing it remotely from home. First, I connected to the UW Campus Traffic Network using the Big-IP client. Then, from the **git bash** terminal:

```
ssh mfisher5@klone.hyak.uw.edu    # login with UW net ID

> ECDSA key fingerprint is <>.
> Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
yes
> Warning: Permanently added 'klone.hyak.uw.edu' to the list of known hosts.
> Password:

my-UW-password                     # enter UW net ID password

> Duo two-factor login for mfisher5
>
> Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:
>
>  1. Duo Push
>  2. Phone call
>
> Passcode or option (1-2):

2                                   # opt for phone call 


cd /gscratch/merlab/                # go to MERlab's home directory
ls
> ctarpey  elpetrou  genomes  mfisher  nclowell  pollock_wgs  singularity_sif  software  usage_report.txt

cd mfisher
ls
> stacks_b8_wgenome
```

Carolyn copied in all of my intermediate Stacks files that I'll need to run populations. 


## 2: Download and Install Stacks

I went looking for older versions of Stacks, and found that the following are available as downloads on the [*Frequently Asked Questions*](https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/faq.php#prev) webpage: 

- stacks-1.19.tar.gz
- stacks-1.23.tar.gz
- stacks-1.27.tar.gz
- stacks-1.29.tar.gz
- stacks-1.37.tar.gz
- This is the final version 1 release: stacks-1.48.tar.gz

v1.48 is the closest I can get to v1.44, so I right clicked on the download link and selected *Inspect*. From there, I got this download link: 

`<a href="http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/source/stacks-1.48.tar.gz">stacks-1.48.tar.gz</a>`

Because I cannot edit files in a directory that belongs to a different Hyak user, I created a new root directory for myself (mfisher5). After navigating into that directory, I ran the following code to download and install Stacks v1.48. 

```
wget http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/source/stacks-1.48.tar.gz
tar xzvf stacks-1.48.tar.gz
cd stacks-1.48 
./configure
make 
```

## 3: Re-run `Populations` (or not)

The [`populations` log](https://github.com/mfisher5/Pacific-cod-RADseq/blob/main/data/stacks/batch_7.populations.log) from my final run of the program (2017-09-28) recorded the following input code: 

```
populations -b 7 -P stacks_b8_wgenome -M scripts/PopMap_L1-5.txt -t 36 -r 0.80 -p 4 -m 10 --write_random_snp --genepop --fasta
```

The new documentation for Stacks reads: 

> The per-locus, per-haplotpye FASTA output from the populations program, generated by specifying the --fasta-samples option, provides the full sequence from the RAD locus, for each haplotype, from every sample in the population, for each catalog locus. This output is identical to the populations.haplotypes.tsv output, except it provides the variable sites embedded within the full consensus seqeunce for the locus.

I did not use the `--fasta-samples` option in my original run. 

But there is this old documentation that sounds like the `--fasta` option in my original run may have produced the output I need:

![stacks-doc-img](https://github.com/mfisher5/Pacific-cod-RADseq/blob/main/doc/imgs/stacks-old-populations-fasta-doc.png?raw=true)

To check this out, I'll pull my file `batch_7.fa` off of Hyak. 

```
rsync --verbose --archive --progress mfisher5@klone.hyak.uw.edu:/gscratch/merlab/mfisher/stacks_b8_wgenome/batch_7.fa /Downloads
```
<br>

The Stacks manual then provides this code to get the internal Sample IDs used by Stacks:
```
ls -1 *.alleles.tsv | 
  while read line; do echo -n $line | 
  sed -E -e 's/^(.+)\.alleles\.tsv$/\1\t/'; cat $line | head -n 1 | cut -f 2;
  done
  
>BOR07_01        # pstacks version 1.44; generated on 2017-09-28 04:05:27
>BOR07_01_2      # pstacks version 1.44; generated on 2017-09-28 04:24:22
>BOR07_02.1      # pstacks version 1.44; generated on 2017-09-28 04:06:02
>BOR07_03        # pstacks version 1.44; generated on 2017-09-28 04:06:36
>BOR07_04        # pstacks version 1.44; generated on 2017-09-28 04:07:28
>BOR07_05.1      # pstacks version 1.44; generated on 2017-09-28 04:08:41
>BOR07_06.1      # pstacks version 1.44; generated on 2017-09-28 04:09:34
>BOR07_07.1      # pstacks version 1.44; generated on 2017-09-28 04:10:24

```

I have to change it a bit to read my old files....

```
ls -1 *.alleles.tsv | 
  while read line; do echo -n $line | 
  sed -E -e 's/^(.+)\.alleles\.tsv$/\1\t/'; cat $line | head -n 2 | tail -n 1 | cut -f 2;
  done
  
>BOR07_01        267
>BOR07_01_2      289
>BOR07_02.1      268
>BOR07_03        269
>BOR07_04        270
>BOR07_05.1      271
>BOR07_06.1      272
```

This worked for every file except GEO020414_13.alleles.tsv, which is apparently empty...
I copied the output in the terminal into a text file, that I can use to interpret the fasta file. 


## 4: Generate Migrate input files

I can maybe use a python script by Paul Maier (April 22, 2016; Written for Python 2.7.5) to generate the Migrate files from the populations fasta file. 
I need to bring some files into Hyak to do this:

```
# attempt 1
rsync --verbose --archive --progress /Documents/Pacific-cod-RADseq/data/migrate/migrate_loci_list.txt mfisher5@klone.hyak.uw.edu:/gscratch/merlab/mfisher5/migrate
# attempt 2
rsync --verbose --archive --progress /Documents/migrate_loci_list.txt mfisher5@klone.hyak.uw.edu:/gscratch/merlab/mfisher5/migrate
# attempt 3
rsync --verbose --archive --progress /c/Users/mcf05/Documents/Pacific-cod-RADseq/data/migrate/migrate_loci_list.txt mfisher5@klone.hyak.uw.edu:/gscratch/merlab/mfisher5/migrate
# attempt 4
scp /Documents/migrate_loci_list.txt mfisher5@klone.hyak.uw.edu:/gscratch/merlab/mfisher5/migrate
# attempt 5
scp /c/Users/mcf05/Documents/migrate_loci_list.txt mfisher5@klone.hyak.uw.edu:/gscratch/merlab/mfisher5/migrate
# attempt 6
scp ./migrate_loci_list.txt mfisher5@klone.hyak.uw.edu:/gscratch/merlab/mfisher5/migrate
```

And install Python 2.7.5
```
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.5/Python-2.7.5.tgz
tar xzvf Python-2.7.5.tgz
cd Python-2.7.5
./configure
make 

python2 -V
>Python 2.7.18
```


Then I *should* be able to run the following code from within my `mfisher5` folder:
``` 
python2 migrate/fasta2genotype.py migrate/batch_7.fa migratemigrate_loci_list.txt migrate/migrate_stacksIDs_finalgenepop NA migrate/pcod-korea-migrate-input
```

## 5 `Rerun Populations` (for real)

The `fasta2genotype.py` script does not seem to be working, so I am going to re-run Stacks' `populations` on Hyak and produce a VCF file. Then I'll replicate the filtering (for individuals, loci) that I did after the original `populations` run. This is based on MerLab's [How to use Slurm](https://github.com/merlab-uw/Klone/blob/main/HowToUseSlurm.md) documentation. 

Returning a VCF file from `populations` requires a minor change to my original input code: 
```
populations -b 7 -P stacks_b8_wgenome -M scripts/PopMap_L1-5.txt -t 36 -r 0.80 -p 4 -m 10 --write_random_snp --genepop --fasta --vcf
```

I think that to use `slurm` on Hyak, I need this code saved into a [.sh file](https://github.com/mfisher5/Pacific-cod-RADseq/blob/main/scripts/Migrate/rerun_populations.sh). 


The full code for re-running populations on Hyak:

```
# navigate to home directory
cd /gscratch/merlab/mfisher5   

# upload population map
rsync --verbose --archive --progress /Documents/Pacific-cod-RADseq/data/stacks/PopMap_L1-5.txt mfisher5@klone.hyak.uw.edu:/gscratch/merlab/mfisher5/stacks

# upload populations batch file
rsync --verbose --archive --progress /Documents/Pacific-cod-RADseq/data/scripts/rerun_populations.sh mfisher5@klone.hyak.uw.edu:/gscratch/merlab/mfisher5

# rerun populations (assumes 'stacks' subdirectory contains stacks intermediate files)
sbatch rerun_populations.sh

```

If I can't get this to work, I think Carolyn may have to run it out of the 'mfisher' directory. I'm assuming that there is a subdirectory called 'stacks' within the 'mfisher' home directory, which contains all of the intermediate stacks files. 

```
# navigate to home directory
cd /gscratch/merlab/mfisher   

# upload population map 
rsync --verbose --archive --progress /Documents/Pacific-cod-RADseq/data/stacks/PopMap_L1-5.txt ctarpey@klone.hyak.uw.edu:/gscratch/merlab/mfisher/stacks

# upload populations batch file 
rsync --verbose --archive --progress /Documents/Pacific-cod-RADseq/data/scripts/rerun_populations.sh ctarpey@klone.hyak.uw.edu:/gscratch/merlab/mfisher


# rerun populations (assumes 'stacks' subdirectory contains stacks intermediate files)
sbatch rerun_populations.sh

# see information about the job and the job id
squeue --account merlab

```
