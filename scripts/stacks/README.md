## Scripts >> Stacks

Code for running Stacks v1.44. Since sequencing data was generated by lane, some scripts may contain a subset of samples from a single lane of sequencine (e.g., **process_radtags** will process samples from the fifth sequencing lane only); however, the same parameters were used across all samples in all sequencing lanes. 

In order:

1. **process_radtags**
2. **ustacks**
3. **cstacks**
4. **pstacks-to-populations**

Note included are the various python and bash scripts used for intermediate / post-stacks filtering.
